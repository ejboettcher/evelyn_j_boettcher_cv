I like to create new things ranging from electronics to sewing. 

## One Twenty One

A multiplication version of 21 / BlackJack.  The game is designed to help the user increase their ability to do mental math.  All cards are multiplied together. There is one addition that you can place anywhere between the cards.  ![121 Social Image](assets/img/121_social_sm.png){: .align-right}
