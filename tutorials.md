## Science Saturday 

Backyard science with common household equipment. Goal is to show that science is:

* Interesting
* Does not need expensive equipment 
* Something you can do at home 
* A kid (at heart too) can do alone
  * Adult supervision RECOMMENDED
* Emphasize that science is all around us and not just something that happens in a lab.
  * One way to do that, is to use everyday objects to do science.
* Doable in less than an hour
