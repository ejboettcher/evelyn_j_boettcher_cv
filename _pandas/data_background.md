## Large Data: 

Big data has been around for a long time.

###  Attributes of Large Data

* Access controlled
* Shows what it shows
* <b>Grows</b>

## Access controlled: planet datasets

In the 1600, Johannes Kepler used Tycho Brahe large dataset on planet observations 
to prove how planets orbit the sun.  

<br/>

+ Unfortunately, Kepler had to wait until Tycho Brahe died before he could get a hold of a large data set.  
<br/>

+ Many thought he played a hand in Brahe's death

## Large Data: Shows what it shows

You always had to take time to understand it.

### Eclipse of IO

In 1676 Ole Roemer (RÃ¸mer) armed with only paper, pencil, telescope and 
a mechanical watch, calculated the speed of LIGHT! 
Was within 30% simply by looking at Jupiter's moon Io.  

### Prior to this people thought that light was instantaneous! 

His prediction for Io was off by a few minutes.

## Measuring the Speed of Light

This required LOTS of observations over years and years by multiple people.  

Romer was calculating when Io would have an eclipse and not the speed of light; 
so he must have had to recalculate he calculations over and over again
by hand to ensure there was not a mistake in the math or observations.

<br/>

### Roemer's Conclusion

+ My work is correct, <br/>
+ the timing is off because light moves at a finite speed.

## Our Large Data 

We have it a bit easier, we only having to deal with:

* NaNs: Not A Number
* Slow downloads speeds



We still have to deal with

* Access control
* Easter eggs in the data
* Data growth

### But, you say,
#### "My data is BIG (larger than my computer's working memory) and I want an answer today and not wait a decade."

### Lets talk about the Python library: Pandas.
