## Motivation
Data sets can get large quickly.  
You can quickly go from looking at a few 100 lines and a handful of columns to a million lines and hundred of columns.  

Luckily, we live in a time where the processing power on a laptops  
 would have made the engineers who put a man on the moon; swoon.

Well this talk is for you.  
I will show how python pandas library with smart use of categories can allow you to read in large data on a laptop.
