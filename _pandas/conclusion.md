## Conclusion

* Pandas can handle data that most *GUI* readers (Office Libre, Excel) can not read in.  
    
* We reduced the size of data in working memory to LESS than the file size at rest (sometimes)!
   * Reduction can be as large as 90%

* Categories can be **Helpful** or **Hurtful** when we are dealing with large data.
   * Please use Pandas with care
