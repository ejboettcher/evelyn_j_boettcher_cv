    - Provided SME for a wide range of fields: Python, EO and Thermal Sensing, Git and AWS for AFRL Sensor Directorate
    - Analyzed large data to find correlations between Elint and
        tracks.
    - Technical lead for a new research areas withing AFRL which
        successfully, integrated automatic target recognition software
        from a variety of languages and modalities
    - Processed SWAMI's Blue Heron LWIR HSI data to feed into DARPA's
        InSight system
    - UAS Detection from their LiDAR sensor using IP cameras.
    - Worked with a ROS (Robot OS) /Gaszebo LiDAR simulator to
        generate training imagery, train a LiDAR machine learn algorithm and run the LiDAR
        ATR in a simulated environment.
    - Developed web applications to render 3D models for AFRL
        Sensors Target Model Library
    - Developed and published android applications for DiDacTex's
        internal efforts

**InfoSciTex a DCS Corporation:** Dayton, OH (Sept. 2012- April 2015)
Physicist / Technical Leader

Technical leader for the Automatic Human Threat Detection group for
AFRL’s Human MASINT program. Lead a group of computer scientist to
create detection and classification algorithms of humans in EO imagery
and Radar signatures. Personal research includes automatic
classification of a person’s gender in EO FMV imagery (presented at MSS
2014) using extracted limb size. Examined human bio-metric relation to
help uniquely identify a person (IEEE H&S 2015) and predict age. This
research involves extracting silhouettes, developing detection
algorithms, calibrating imagery: lab measure and from single imagery,
and extracting anthropomorphic measures within the image with/without
any meta data.
