        InSight system
    -   UAS Detection from their LiDAR sensor using IP cameras.

**InfoSciTex a DCS Corporation:** Dayton, OH Sept. 2012- April 2015

Physicist / Technical Leader

Technical leader for the Automatic Human Threat Detection group for
AFRL’s Human MASINT program. Lead a group of computer scientist to
create detection and classification algorithms of humans in EO imagery
and Radar signatures. Personal research includes automatic
classification of a person’s gender in EO FMV imagery (presented at MSS
2014) using extracted limb size. Examined human bio-metric relation to
help uniquely identify a person (IEEE H&S 2015) and predict age. This
research involves extracting silhouettes, developing detection
algorithms, calibrating imagery: lab measure and from single imagery,
and extracting anthropomorphic measures within the image with/without
any meta data.

-   Lead human signature collections involving multiple groups: NASIC,
    AFRL/RH AFRL/RYM & GTRI
-   Helped customer to create collaborative agreements with PNNL and
    ADSS
-   Designed a camera calibration system to map cameras to each other
    and other systems
-   Wrote white papers for BAAs
-   Published and presented research

**Jacobs:** Dayton, OH Sept. 2011-Sept. 2012

Physicist

Researcher working on a multifaceted challenge problem for AFRL at
Wright Patterson AFB on Hyperspectral Imagery (HSI). The focus is to
understand the variables that affect performance in automatic detection
algorithms and provide the community with a rich source of data and
experiments to further development.

-   Built image readers for HSI imagery and specra signatures.
-   Analyzed and characterized spectral signatures
-   Measured performance of HSI detection algorithms

**DCS Corporation:** Alexandria, VA 

Electrical Engineer III OCT. 2006- April 2010

Researcher to Night Vision & Electronic Sensors Directorate, (NVESD)
providing engineering support to the Modeling and Simulation Division in
Field Performance Branch; focusing on conducting various tests on human
perception, calibrating NVThermIP models for new tasks, automating image
and video processing and running field tests using a variety of sensors:
LWIR, MWIR, SWIR, mmW, and visible.

-   Modeled Soldier’s performance using NVESD models for human
    activities and personnel targets. In all experiments care was made
    to ensure the “actor” for the activity did not bias results.
    Soldiers were trained to ID/Rec/Detect and activity or clothing/
    weapon or clothing/tool
-   Human Activities test was thermal videos at various image qualities
    (“range”) of a variety of activities. It examined how well a Soldier
    can ID/Rec/Detect an activity of interest.
-   Produced & delivered technical briefings & research findings to
    customers (ARL, FAA, Marines, Navy, JIEDO) and at national meetings.
-   Created proposals to conduct new research.
-   Authored test plans, led field tests and coordinated people and
    resources for various experiments.
-   Developed training materials to help Soldiers identify planes,
    boats, human activities, and PBIED (suicide bombers) in multiple
    wavebands.
-   Independently investigated the effect of test design on test takers’
    performance.
